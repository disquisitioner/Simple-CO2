# Simple CO2 Monitor
While it's a good idea to have air quality measuring devices deployed in occupied portions of a home or office, sometimes you want a portable, self-contained CO2 monitor you can take with you to meetings, events, and when traveling.  This project provides a simple verison of such a device using a Sensirion SCD40 to measure carbon dioxide, temperature and humidity and a built-in TFT display to show ongoing readings.

Several different screens of information can be shown, including all current sensor readings, an easily glanceable red/yellow/green CO2 air quality indication, screen-saver style CO2-only status, and a cumulative table of max, min, and average values.  A single push-button allows sequencing through the screens.

The current version supports a combination of [Adafruit ESP32 V2 Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5400) and [Adafruit 240x135 Color TFT Display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4383), with the separate components well suited for incorporation in an enclosure. Work is under way to add support for the [Adafruit ESP32-S3 Reverse TFT Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5691), which provides all needed hardware components in a single board for simpler development and greater portability.  By design the sketch properly configures itself using information provided by the Arduino IDE along with a few special settings documented in the `config.h` configuration file.
